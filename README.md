# CALL CENTER ANALYSIS

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze a call center dataset to derive meaningful insights that can help improve customer service operations, enhance customer satisfaction, and identify areas for optimization

### Data Sources
Call center Data: The primary dataset used for this project is the "Callcenter.csv", containing detailed information about each call received by the call center company.

### Tools
- Excel - Data Analysis, Creating Report


### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the call center data to answer key questions, such as:

-  Which communication channel was used the most?
-  Which Call center received the most call?
-  What are the common reasons for negative sentiment in customer calls?

  ### Findings/Results
  
1. The call centre is the most preferred communication channel.
2. LA Call center received the highest volume of calls. 
4. Billing related reasons are the major cause for negative and very negative sentiments.

### Recommendations

### Based on the Analysis, we recommend the following actions:
 - Encourage greater use of chatbots, email, and web channels to reduce call centre congestion.
 - Allocate more resources (staff, training, technology) to the LA call centre to manage the complaint load effectively.
 - Conduct a comprehensive review of the billing process to identify systemic issues.
