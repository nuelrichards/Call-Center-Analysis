# CALL CENTER ANALYSIS

## Project Overview

### Objective

The goal of this project is to analyze a call center dataset to derive meaningful insights that can help improve customer service operations, enhance customer satisfaction, and identify areas for optimization

### Data Sources
Call center Data: The primary dataset used for this project is the "Callcenter.csv", containing detailed information about each call received by the call center company.

### Tools
- Excel - Data Analysis, Creating Report


### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the call center data to answer key questions, such as:

-  Which communication channel was used the most?
-  Which Call center received the most call?
-  What are the common reasons for negative sentiment in customer calls?

  ### Summary and Conclusion
  
1.	The call centre is the most preferred communication channel (32.3%), with LA receiving the highest volume of complaints. This suggests regional differences in customer service needs or operational issues specific to LA.
2.	Billing-related complaints dominate customer interactions, accounting for 71.9% of all complaints. However, these customers are also the most dissatisfied, contributing 71.1% of negative reviews.
3.	Despite 62.6% of issues being resolved within SLA, dissatisfaction remains prevalent. This indicates that resolution quality is inadequate, and customers likely feel their complaints are not effectively addressed.
4.	Sentiment analysis reveals that 51.9% of customers are dissatisfied (negative + very negative reviews), with billing and service outage complaints being the primary drivers of dissatisfaction.
5.	The customer experience is inconsistent across channels and regions, contributing to a breakdown in trust and satisfaction with the call centre's services.


### Recommendations

### Based on the Analysis, we recommend the following actions:

1.	### Focus on Billing Issue Resolution:
  - Conduct a comprehensive review of the billing process to identify systemic issues.
  - Implement proactive measures such as automated alerts for billing discrepancies and simplified billing statements to reduce confusion.
  - Train agents to handle billing complaints more effectively.
    
2.	### Improve Service Quality in LA:
   - Investigate the reasons behind LA's disproportionately high call volume.
	 - Allocate more resources (staff, training, technology) to the LA call centre to manage the complaint load effectively.
     
3.	### Enhance Complaint Resolution Process:
    - Introduce a post-resolution customer survey to gather feedback on complaint handling.
    - Increase agent accountability by tracking resolution rates and linking performance evaluations to customer satisfaction scores.
      
4.	### Sentiment-Driven Action Plans:
    - Use sentiment analysis tools to monitor real-time customer feedback and adapt strategies accordingly.
    
5.	### Develop Alternative Customer Support Channels:
    - Encourage greater use of chatbots, email, and web channels to reduce call centre congestion.
    - Improve the functionality and user experience of these alternative channels to make them more appealing to customers.
    
### By addressing these areas, the call centre can significantly improve its customer experience, reduce dissatisfaction, and ensure more effective handling of complaints.
